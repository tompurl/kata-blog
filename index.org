** DONE Fizzbuzz Using Robot Framework                      :robot_framework:
   CLOSED: [2019-10-17 Thu 20:51]
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
*** Overview
    The first thing I always try to do to learn a new language after writing "hello
    world" is implementing [[http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/][fizzbuzz]]. This wasn't true with the Robot Framework, so I
    thought it would be time to give it a try.

*** My Implementation

   #+INCLUDE: "./code/katas/robot-framework/fizzbuzz.robot" src robot

*** Observations

    The first thing I learned from this exercise was how surprisingly difficult it
    was to evaluate the result of an expression. If I was running this in Python I
    would do something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  for num in range(1, 101):
      if num % 15 == 0:
          print("fizzbuzz")
      elif num % 3 == 0:
          print("fizz")
      elif num % 5 == 0:
          print("buzz")
      else:
          print(num)
#+END_SRC

    I can evaluate the =num % 3= part within the else statement using Python. But
    here’s what I *can’t* do using the Robot Framework:

 
#+BEGIN_SRC robot
  Run keyword if    Is Mod Zero    ${number}    15   Log to Console    FIZZBUZZ
  ...    ELSE IF    Run keyword and return status    Is Mod Zero    ${number}    3     Log to Console    FIZZ
  …
#+END_SRC


    I’m sure *something* like this is possible without creating a temporary variable
    (and evaluating the =Is Mod Zero= 3 times *every time*) but I’m not quite sure
    what it is.

    The second thing I learned was how easy it was to run a Python one-liner from
    Robot. If that didn’t work then I simply didn’t see how I was going to evaluate a
    modulus from Robot without writing a Python module (for a one-liner).

  Moving around one line at a time:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
                        Previous line, C-p
                                :
                                :

                          Next line, C-n
  #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Emulating Vim's "gg top" Mnemonic

  In Vim when you are in normal mode you can jump to the beginning of a
  document by pressing =gg= and the end by pressing =G=. Here are some
  keybindings for Emacs that are similar:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x gg") 'beginning-of-buffer)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x G")  'end-of-buffer)

  #+END_SRC
 
*** Search

  - Incremental Search
      - =C-s=
      - To find the next match just keep pressing =C-s=

  - =M-x replace-string=
    - Find and replace on every instance of a string from the cursor position to the end of the document.

*** File Management

  - Creating a new file
      - Find it =(C-x C-f)=
      - Type in the location where you want to save it.
  - Saving a file
      - =C-x C-s=

**** Registers

  Registers are good for quickly storing and finding all kinds of things, but I
  mostly use them to open files that I use a lot. For example, I can put the 
  following in my =.emacs= file:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ; Org index
      (set-register ?i (cons 'file "c:/td/gtd/org/index.org"))
      ; .emacs file
      (set-register ?e (cons 'file "~/.emacs"))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  …and then open the files like this:
 
  =C-x r j i=

  =C-x r j e= 
**** Recovery

  To recover a file, open it and then type =M-x recover-file=.

*** Text Management

**** Misc

  - Auto wrap a line by adding a carriage return
      - Similar to =gqip= in Vim
      - =M-q=
  - Selecting Text
      - Simply go to the beginning, press =C-Space= and then navigate to the end
        position.
      - This is a lot like a visual select in Vim.

**** Copying And Pasting With The Kill Ring

  =<DEL>= in Emacs parlance means "Backspace", not "Delete". For that,
  they use =<DELETE>=.

  - =<DEL>=
    - Delete the character just before the cursor. Using the =<DEL>= key
      does *not* add the text to the kill ring, so avoid it when you can.
  - =C-d=
    -  Delete the next character after the cursor
  - =M-<DEL>=
    - Kill the word immediately before the cursor
  - =M-d=
    - Kill the next word after the cursor
  - =C-k=
    - Kill from the cursor position to end of line
  - =M-k=
    - Kill to the end of the current sentence
  - =C-w=
    - Kill selected text
  - =C-y=
    - Yanks the last text killed. With Emacs, "yank" means "yank it off
      of the kill ring", *not* "cut" like it does in Vim.  If you kill a
      bunch of text repeatedly, then one yank pastes all of that text
      back.
  - =M-y=
    - Allows you to "cycle through" your kill ring. If the text retured
      by C-y isn't what you want, jus type this until you see the text
      you want.


**** CUA Mode

  CUA Mode allows you to use C-c and C-v when you have selected text. Here’s more
  information:

  - http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CuaMode

  …and here’s what I added to me .emacs file:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (cua-mode t)
      (setq cua-auto-tabify-recptangles nil) ;; Don't tabify after rectangle commands
      (transient-mark-mode 1) ;; No region when it is not highlighted
      (setq cua-keep-region-after-copy t) ;; Standard Windows behavior
  #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Editing Search Buffers
    One of my favorite features of Emacs is how easy it is to edit the *results* of a
    search buffer. Here's how you do that in different scenarios.
**** Word Search
     TODO
**** File Name Search
     1. First find the files using =find-name-dired=.
     2. Then use =wdired= to edit the results.
*** Scripting

**** Interrogating A Variable VAles

  If you want to find out the current value of a variable, just type the
  following:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      C-h v <var name>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  For example:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      C-h v org-agenda-files
  #+END_EXAMPLE
*** File Encodings

**** Remove Version Page On Startup

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

      (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
      (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
        (lambda () (delete-other-windows)) t)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Change The Default Web Browser

  This is all I had to add to my =.emacs= file on my Windows 7 machine to
  start using Firefox instead of IE:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Show Line Numbers

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      M-x linum-mode
  #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Toggle Word Wrap

  This is similar to the =:set nowrap= command in Vim, except it toggles
  the option:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  M-x toggle-truncate-lines

*** Emacs
     Make sure that you create a ctags/etags file so you can use the [[help:robot-mode-find-kw][robot-mode-find-kw]]
     function to jump to a keyword's definition.

     On windows, I had the best luck with the Universal Ctags executable. Here's the
     command that I use at my project's root to generate my tags file for Emacs:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       cd project-root
       ctags.exe -e --langmap="Robot:.robot.txt" -R

*** Debugging
**** General
     This is an excellent reference:

     - https://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.robotframework/docs/source/debugging.html
**** Dumping All Variable Values
     Use the following keyword to dump all of the existing variables:

     - =Log Variables    level=INFO=

     Please note that the =level= is VERY important. Just choose INFO and you'll see
     everything you care about.
*** Docker-Related Helpers
    This is an excellent tutorial on using Docker with the Robot Framework:

    - https://medium.com/@ypasmk/robot-framework-with-docker-in-less-than-10-minutes-7b86df769c22

    This is really more Chrome and Docker related than Robot Framework related, but
    this is a very promising technique for visually troubleshooting a Robot Framework
    job that is a) driving a web browser and b) running in a Docker container. 

    First start your Docker container that contains Chrome using a command that looks
    something like this:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      docker run --rm -it -p 9222:9222 -v /home/tom/git/robot-code:/home/jenkins/code --entrypoint bash foo/some-chrome-image
    #+END_SRC

    Once you're using the container's interactive shell run this command:

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      /usr/bin/google-chrome \
          --disable-gpu --headless --no-sandbox \
          --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 \
          --remote-debugging-port=9222
    #+END_SRC

    Then, on the host machine, visit the following URL in Chrome or Firfox:

    - http://localhost:9222

    ... and then click on the =about:blank= link. 

    You can now see a "window" into the browser running within the container.

    Again, this doesn't have enough wiring to work with Robot Framework yet. That's
    something I still need to figure out. But what I'm *hoping* is that I'll figure
    out a way to watch my Robot Framework tests in a browser while they're running
    withing a Docker container.

*** Creating A New Remote For A Local Repo

  This process is used when:

  1. You have code on your local machine that is in a git repo.
  2. This code is not currently pushed to a remote.
  3. You want to store a remote on a different filesystem (e.g. a
     directory accessible over NFS or SSH).

  In this example I'm pushing to a shared Windows drive.

  #+BEGIN_SRC ps
    # Navigate to the location of where you want to store your code.
    cd \\some-server\share$\tom\git
    git init --bare dotemacs

    # Now navigate to your repo and push
    cd c:\users\tom\.emacs
    git remote add origin '\\some-server\share$\tom\git\dotemacs'
    git push --set-upstream origin master
    git push origin --mirror
  #+END_SRC

  Now you can backup your repo to a different server and even share your
  code with others who have access to that shared directory.

*** Convincing Git That a File Isn't Binary
    I have an issue occasionally where =git= thinks that some of my text files are
    binary. Specifically, this seems to happen frequently with my =requirements.txt=
    files. Here's what I've done to fix this.

    Please note that this process still seems a bit black-magicky to me. Some of
    these steps may not be necessary.

    1. In my repository, create a =.gitattributes= files with the following contents:
       1. =*.txt text working-tree-encoding=UTF-16LE eol=CRLF=
       2. I chose this text encoding because it appears to be the default on my
          Windows laptop running emacs.
    2. I set the encoding of my file to =utf-8-dos= in Emacs and saved it.
    3. Commit both files to the =git= repo.
    4. Make another change to the target text file (e.g. =requirements.txt=).

    You should now be able to perform a "text" diff on your files.

    I'm "ride or die" with Emacs, so I use that as my editor/IDE. I set things up
    very similarly to what you will see here:

    - https://realpython.com/emacs-the-best-python-editor/

    I also use =pipenv= for dependency and virtualenv management. 

*** Pipenv
**** Rebuilding a virtual environment
     One of the great things about =pipenv= is that it makes virtual environment
     management relatively brainless. For example, here's how I rebuild a "clean"
     virtual environment:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     # Assuming that you're within the "broken" virtualenv shell
     exit
     pipenv --rm
     pipenv --python <path to python interpreter in your pipfile>
     pipenv install
     pipenv install --dev
     pipenv shell
     #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Creating a New Project
     Assuming that your project does not *yet* have a Pipfile, here's how I create
     one:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     pipenv --python <path to preferred python interpreter>
     pipenv install --dev jupyter jedi rope autopep8 yapf flake8 pytest pytest-cache
     echo 'Pipfile.lock -diff' >> .gitattributes
     cat <<EOF >> .gitignore

     .coverage
     htmlcov/

     dist/
     build/
     *.egg-info/
     EOF
     #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Managing Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
     This is a good resource:

     - https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/598

     This comment in particular is very helpful:

     - https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/598#issuecomment-505433122

     In general...
     - Yes, you should add them both to your git repo.
     - You should add =Pipfile.lock -diff= to your =.gitattributes= file so that git
       doesn't try to perform text-based diffs with it.
*** Solving PYTHONPATH Issues
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: solving-pythonpath
    :END:
    I had an issue lately where a Python script in a virtualenv was not
    using the versions of the libraries that were installed in that
    virtualenv. Here's some tips that I learned when debugging the
    issue.
**** Checking The Instance Of Python Being Executed
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: checking-python-instance
     :END:
     First, are you *sure* that you're running the Python executable
     that you think you're running?

     The proper version of Python may not be executed just because
     you're running a script within virtualenv. This is easy to test by
     simply checking the process table. Also, you can try prepending
     your script like this:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       python -m your-script.py
     #+END_SRC

     This was my big mistake the last time I had PYTHONPATH
     issues. After checking the version of Python that was running when
     I executed my script I noticed that it was from a *completely
     different virtualenv*.
**** Checking The Loaded Libraries At Runtime 
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: checking-loaded-libraries-at-runtime
     :END:
     If you'd like to see what libraries are being loaded and from

     execute your Python script:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       python -v -m your-script.py
     #+END_SRC

*** TLS Oddities
**** Converting an Encrypted Keypair Into Friendly Formats
     If you want to use client-side TLS with the =requests= library then the easiest
     way to do that is with an unencrypted keypair, with one file for each key. Easy,
     right?

     Welllll I tried doing this 10 different ways with my favorite TLS tool Key Store
     Explorer but just couldn't find the proper format that the =requests= library
     was expecting. Thank goodness I finally found the following:

     - https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/1573#issuecomment-188125157

     Here's my shamelessly copying and pasting it:

***** Generate certificate and private key.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   // Generate the certificate file.
   openssl pkcs12 -in /path/to/p12cert -nokeys -out certificate.pem
   // Generate private key with passpharse, First enter the password provided with the key and then an arbitrary PEM password //(say: 1234) 
   openssl pkcs12 -in /path/to/p12cert -nocerts -out privkey.pem
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Well, we are not done yet and we need to generate the key that doesn't require the
   PEM password every time it needs to talk to the server.

***** Generate key without passphrase.
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      // Running this command will prompt for the pem password(1234), on providing which we will obtain the plainkey.pem
      openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out plainkey.pem

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE -r
  What I mean to say is if you know you don't deserve [a status] at some level, then
  you can have a Reckoning with that and try to do good in the world.

  But if that status, whatever it is, is protecting you from some inner oblivion, it's
  very quick [...] to come to the point where your mind then tells you "of *course* I
  deserve this."

  You will sometimes hear a certain kind of poet talk about how they have
  learned that energy can never be destroyed. They say how wonderful this is
  because it means that all the energy that people create with their love
  will survive forever. Their soul mate may have died in a tragic banjo accident,
  but the eternal energy of their love will always be with them.
  Except that love is not a phenomenon of energy, but rather a consequence of
  the distribution of energy. It comes about because of patterns and organized
  structures in your brain, built of matter and energy. In other words, love is
  a child of entropy, not energy.
  Those patterns that are love do not have any conservation law backing them up
  the way energy does. They come and go. In fact, the law of increasing entropy
  says that they will go, sooner or later.
  What had been pattern will become void, like a chalk painting washed away by
  the rain - the chalk survives even as it is washed down the drain, but the
  painting is gone.
  Your love and the love of everyone who has ever loved you will be washed away
  in the inevitable, unstoppable, universal flushing down the drain that is the
  fundamental law of increasing entropy. And then the sun will engulf the earth
  and reduce it to ash before shrinking into a white dwarf and dying in obscurity.
  Sorry.

  “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by

  great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself
  with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words,
  and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though
  it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure
  to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood?
  Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and
  Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit
  that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.”

  Paths Of Glory]] episode of the [[https://thenextpictureshow.tumblr.com/][The Next Picture Show]] podcast. She ended
  up really liking Wonder Woman, but here (at 03:41) she describes why
  her expectations were so low:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE -r

  I think my expectations have been set by how much I've *consistently
  hated* the DC extended universe movies, how many problems I've had with
  them, both just in terms of them all kindof being narratively messy
  and/or, just insensitive to /basic humanity/.

  #+END_QUOTE

  My gripe with these especially bad superhero movies is that Warner
  Brothers seems to be *consistently* making them like this on purpose
  (with Wonder Woman as an exception). It seems bizarre to me that
  someone sits in a room, has an idea to make a movie like Batman V
  Superman, makes it, sees how it turns out, and then says "yes, that's
  great, let's do that again".

  I didn't respond with rage to any of what was happening

  farther. And I am of the belief that the election of someone like
  Donald Trump is in part a direct result of an electorate too far
  ensconced in their own ideological readouts to communicate even the
  simplest disagreements constructively. And that has to stop.

   Do you want to learn more about "the blockchain" but don't know where to start?
   Are you an experiential learner who prefers to learn by doing? And would you
   prefer to learn without spending much money?

   In the presentation below I go over "dipping your toes" into the Ethereum
   blockchain for complete beginners. We cover:

   - Setting up a wallet
   - Buying and managing a cryptocurrency (Ether)
   - Common gotchas

   The goal is to teach you how to fish and "bootstrap" your own process for learning
   about the blockchain. It's easy, fairly inexpensive and very, very educational
   (the process, not the presentation). Also, if you're lucky you can be the first
   kid on your block to own a crypto-collectible.

** DONE Reasons For Not Writing Your API Tests In Postman :testing:api:postman:robot_framework:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Reasons_For_Not_Using_Postman
   :EXPORT_DATE: 4/14/2020
   :END:
   A co-worker of mine recently asked me why I prefer to write automated REST API
   tests using the [[https://robotframework.org/][Robot Framework]]. Specifically, he couldn't understand why I didn't
   just automate everything using [[https://www.postman.com/][Postman]], which is a very popular way of doing such
   things.

   I was a little surprised by what I told him and thought that this may help other
   so I here's my rationale. If I'm wrong I'm sure someone will let me know :-)

   1. Postman doesn't really support the idea of a *"setup" and "teardown"
      functions*. The closest analogues are "pre-request scripts" and "Tests". These
      are good at a request level, but a test case is often larger than just one
      request. I'm a huge fan of how Robot Framework handles test case and
      suite-level setup and teardown functionality and how you can configure it as an
      annotation.

   2. Code that you write in the "pre-request scripts" and "tests" sections *can't
      easily be modularized into external libraries*. So for example, if each request
      requires you to run 10 lines of JS as a pre-request script, then you're copying
      and pasting that JS into each and every request. If you need to make a change
      to that JS, then you need to copy and paste the new JS into each request. This
      makes things very difficult to maintain.

   3. It's difficult to *follow the workflows of a Postman test suite*. Let's say
      that you want to run request #1 before you run request #2, and if everything
      works then run request #3. Then let's say that you want to run request #4, then
      2 and 3. I've seen examples on how to do this but it's very, very kludgy and I
      wouldn't want to maintain those scripts or follow that bouncing ball.

   4. The response I've seen to #3 is that you just *simplify* your test cases as much
      as possible and then *put everything else you test needs to do in JS*. But then
      that takes us back to #2.

   So what is Postman good for? To me, the killer feature of Postman is that you can
   "kick the tires" of your API and then write your test using a single tool that is
   nearly ubiquitous. And I agree that Postman is by far the best tool I've found for
   quickly poking and prodding a REST API.

   So I guess what I'm saying is, when it comes to prototyping REST calls, Postman is
   hard to beat. However, if I want to actually write a formal test suite that is
   easy to read, write, and maintain, I would much rather use a "real" programming
   language bundled with a good test runner (both of which are included in the Robot
   Framework).

** DONE Lessons Learned - Configuring an Nginx K8S Ingress Using Annotations :digital_ocean:nginx:kubernetes:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: LL_K8S_Nginx_Annotations
   :EXPORT_DATE: 6/5/2020
   :END:
   I recently installed my first Nextcloud server on top of a new Digital Ocean
   Kubernetes (K8S) cluster as a Kubernetes training exercise. I ended up learning a
   *ton* about Kubernetes but I also learned a lot about how to run a Nextcloud
   server.

   One thing I learned very quickly is that most default web server configurations
   don't support uploading files larger than a few megabytes. I therefor got a ton of
   errors the first time I tried syncing an image folder. 

   Since I was using the official *nextcloud:apache* image I figured that the
   built-in Apache server was configured properly. I therefore started looking into
   how I could configure my Kubernetes Ingress to accept large file uploads. And
   since I was using the *Nginx Ingress Controller* it had to be Nginx-specific.

   The docs were a little confusing on this, but the good news is that all I had to
   do was set an annotation in the ingress like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
     apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       annotations:
         cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
         kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
         # maps to client_max_body_size
         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 128m
       name: nextcloud-ingress
     spec:
       tls:
         - hosts:
             - docs.tompurl.com
           secretName: nextcloud-cert-tls
       rules:
         - host: docs.tompurl.com
           http:
             paths:
               - backend:
                   serviceName: nextcloud
                   servicePort: 80
   #+END_SRC

   The key line is this one:
   - =nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 128m=

   My understanding is that this line configures the =client_max_body_size= variable
   in your Ingress' =nginx.conf= file. Granted, it would be nice if the annotation
   had a name that is closer to the conf file variable name, but I'm just glad I
   figured this out 😼

   One of the killer features of using Nginx as your Kubernetes Ingress Controller is
   that you can configure tons of different things using simple annotations. You can
   find more information on them here:

   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: LL_K8S_Where_Is_PV_Stored
   :EXPORT_DATE: 6/5/2020
   :END:
   The most confusing aspect of using Kubernetes for me is *storage*. I mean, they
   *seem* so simple, but take a look at this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC yaml :exports code-or-both
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
     metadata:
       name: mysql-nc-pv-claim
       labels:
         app: nextcloud
     spec:
       accessModes:
         - ReadWriteOnce
       resources:
         requests:
           storage: 5Gi
   #+END_SRC

   Here's some questions that jump to my mind:

   - How is a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) different than a Persistent Volume (PV)?
     Why do I only need a PVC sometimes?
   - What if I eventually need more than 5 gigs of storage? Can I auto resize the partition?
   - What if I wanted to browse this volume using a tool like Windows Explorer? Can I
     get shell access?

   All of these beg the following fundamental question:

*** Where and on What Are My Files Stored?

    Let's assume that you applied the following PVC above and now you want to know
    where the heck your volume is. Your first tool is the =kubectl get pvc=
    command. Here's some sample output from my Digital Ocean Kubernetes cluster:

    Take a look at the *STORAGECLASS* column. Hmm, I wonder what =do-block-storage=
    means? I guess I'll look at the [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/][official Kubernetes docs on storage class
    types]]. That should explain everything, right?

    Uhh, ok. Well, let's see what Google tells us:

    - https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/add-volumes/

    Ahh, thank goodness Digital Ocean wrote up a nice tutorial on this. That explains
    *this specific storage class* very well.

    Good luck!
** DONE Hooray! I Deployed My First Public-Facing App On Kubernetes :nextcloud:digital_ocean:kubernetes:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: My_First_Public_Facing_App_On_K8S
   :EXPORT_DATE: 6/5/2020
   :END:
   I'm happy to say that I deployed my first "real", public-facing app on top of a
   Kubernetes cluster. It's a Nextcloud server and my host is Digital Ocean (DO). So
   far the experience has been very good and I'm very impressed the host and software
   stack.

   My deployment "code" is available here:

   - https://github.com/tompurl/nextcloud-k8s

   The notes are pretty rough and the non-secrets are hard-coded for my needs, so I
   have a bit of work to do before most people can use it :-) However, it does a lot
   of cool things that you can't find in the official Helm package:

   - It splits data among two persistent volumes, one for =/var/www/html/data= (where
     documents are stored) and one for everything else under =/var/www/html=.
   - It relies on the [[https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb][official MariaDB Docker image]], *not* the one maintained by
     Bitnami. This is important if you ever want to run these scripts on an ARM-based
     K3S cluster (which I do soon).
   - It installs less, since it doesn't include Redis or Cron images. Some might say
     that less functionality is a disadvantage but I think it's all about perspective ;-)

   Here's my future goals:

   - Scripts that also work on a K3S cluster running on Raspberry Pi's.
   - A Helm chart
   - Better WebDav support. Currently the DO version of the scripts works with some
     WebDav clients but not all.
** DONE Troubleshooting Errors During a Nextcloud Upgrade from 18 to 19 on Kubernetes :nextcloud:kubernetes:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Nextcloud_Upgrade_From_18_19_K8S
   :EXPORT_DATE: 6/9/2020
   :END:
*** Background
   Today I upgrading my Nextcloud server from version 18 to 19 by simply changing the
   Docker image version tag like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        kubectl --record deployment.apps/nextcloud set image deployment.v1.apps/nextcloud nextcloud=nextcloud:19.0.0-apache
   #+END_SRC
   
   After waiting for my Nextcloud pod to start I got a 503 error from Nginx. Hmm I
   thought, this must be a secrets issue since I usually update the deployment using
   the following command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     kubectl apply -k ./
   #+END_SRC

   I therefore updated the version tag for the Nextcloud image in my YAML file and
   ran that command and waited for the pod to start. Once I did I saw that my site
   was in *maintenance mode*.

   Hmm, ok let's look at the logs. Nothing. Uhhhh, now what?
*** Solution
    I learned that you can turn on maintenance mode in Nextcloud by running an =occ=
    command from inside the Nextcloud pod. How does one do that you say?

    First, install the [[https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/][Krew plugin]] for =kubectl=. This allows you to easily install
    other plugins, the [[https://github.com/jordanwilson230/kubectl-plugins/tree/krew#kubectl-exec-as][exec-as plugin]]. This plugin makes it easy to execute commands
    within Kubernetes-managed containers as a non-root user.

    So first I "tunneled into" my Nextcloud container by running this command:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      NC_POD=$(kubectl get pods | grep nextcloud | grep -vi mysql | grep -v svclb | awk '{print $1}') 
      kubectl exec -it "$NC_POD" -- bash
    #+END_SRC

    I'm in! Next I tried turning off maintenance mode like so:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      cd /var/www/html
      ./occ maintenance:mode --off
    #+END_SRC

    When I did I got the following response:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Nextcloud or one of the apps require upgrade - only a limited number of commands are available
You may use your browser or the occ upgrade command to do the upgrade
Maintenance mode disabled                            
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    What a *great* error message! At this point it was clear that the upgrade was not
    yet done. There's hope of fixing this thing!

    I therefore ran the following command while I was still inside that shell:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      ./occ upgrade
    #+END_SRC

    After this completed successfully I was then able to login! 
*** Even More Scripts!
    Naturally, the first thing I did after logging in was to visit this page:

    - https://your.domain/settings/admin/overview

    There I saw that I was supposed to run the following scripts:

    - =occ db:add-missing-indices=
    - =occ db:add-missing-columns=

    I ran those within my pod's shell again and the upgrade was complete. I then
    checked the following page to make sure that I covered everything:

    - https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/maintenance/upgrade.html

    Good luck with your upgrade!
