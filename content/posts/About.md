Hello! I'm Tom. I like to build cool things with computers and share them with
others. I currently work at a company called Wi-Tronix as an Automation
Engineer. My views are my own and are in no way associated with my employer.

If you would like to contact me, the best way is probably [email](tom@tompurl.com). I'm also trying
to become more active on [Mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology/@tompurl/). I used to use Twitter but I
eventually learned to value my sanity :-)
