**3/1/18 Update** - I gave this presentation at the [2/21/18 meeting](https://www.meetup.com/foxvalleycp/events/246749490/) of the [Fox
Valley Computing Professionals](https://www.meetup.com/foxvalleycp) club. It was a lot of fun with a **great** group
of people.

(Seriously, this was only the second time that I attended one of their meetings
and the other members are really friendly and inclusive, which is something you
can't always say about a computer club.)

We spent most of the time talking about [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), which really shouldn't have
been that surprising I guess :-)

Do you want to learn more about "the blockchain" but don't know where to start?
Are you an experiential learner who prefers to learn by doing? And would you
prefer to learn without spending much money?

In the presentation below I go over "dipping your toes" into the Ethereum
blockchain for complete beginners. We cover:

-   Setting up a wallet
-   Buying and managing a cryptocurrency (Ether)
-   Common gotchas

The goal is to teach you how to fish and "bootstrap" your own process for learning
about the blockchain. It's easy, fairly inexpensive and very, very educational
(the process, not the presentation). Also, if you're lucky you can be the first
kid on your block to own a crypto-collectible.

Here's the links to the presentation. The HTML version looks the best:

Here's how I print it on my system to conserve paper:

1.  Choose two-sided printing, **long edge**.
2.  Choose the **landscape** orientation.
