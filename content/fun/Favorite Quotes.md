#### Maintainable: Victor Rentea: Never Separate The Refactoring From The Deliverable {#maintainable-victor-rentea-never-separate-the-refactoring-from-the-deliverable}

Here's a great quote on software development from
<https://maintainable.fm/episodes/victor-rentea-never-separate-the-refactoring-from-the-deliverable-IWvo_ttQ>
[00:19:11]

> Never ever ever ever separate the task of refactoring from the task of getting your
> feature implemented. You should never put refactoring on any board.


#### Sunset Boulevard {#sunset-boulevard}

I just loved this Dana Gould quote at 00:06:39 in the [Pepitone!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/pepitone-30708459) bonus episode
of the Dana Gould Hour Podcast:

> Sunset boulevard is a billboard-lined sluice gate of cultural diarrhea, but
> sometimes you gotta drive it.


#### "Wisconsin Charm" in the 70's {#wisconsin-charm-in-the-70-s}

Henry Zebrowski has dozens if not hundreds of fantastic quotes from the [Last
Podcast on the Left](https://www.lastpodcastontheleft.com/), but as a Chicagoland resident this one really hit home. In
[part 2 of the John Wayne Gacy](http://traffic.libsyn.com/lpotl/2ce8bef8-1f34-48e5-9357-00ff69ccafce.mp3) series the fellas were describing how "charming"
and popular John Wayne Gacy was, and Henry made this comment at 00:50:32:

> I just think he was loud and threw his money around, I think that's just
> Wisconsin Charm (in 1977).

#### John Hodgman On Status and While Male Fragility {#john_hodgman_fragility}

I just finished listening to the [John Hodgman interview](http://tvguidancecounselor.libsyn.com/tv-guidance-counselor-episode-373-john-hodgman-3-d) on the [TV Guidance
Counselor podcast](https://tvguidancecounselor.libsyn.com/) and it was one of the most wonderful things that I've listened
to all year. Not only was it very funny but they talked a lot about while male
fragility and why that philosophy is so easy to accept for many. Here's my
favorite quote at [01:01:08]:

> What I mean to say is if you know you don't deserve [a status] at some level, then
> you can have a Reckoning with that and try to do good in the world.
>
> But if that status, whatever it is, is protecting you from some inner oblivion, it's
> very quick [...] to come to the point where your mind then tells you "of **course** I
> deserve this."

On the lighter side, John Hodgman also started one of his stories with this
statement, which is a masterpiece of silly absurdism:

> And I think this is where I was going with the story but this is where I'll go...

TV Guidance Counselor Podcast: TV Guidance Counselor Episode 354: Emma Dumont <http://tvguidancecounselor.libsyn.com/tv-guidance-counselor-episode-354-emma-dumont> [01:25:45]

Here they're discussing "The five thousand fingers of Dr. T" :

"Those kids movies that are surreal and dark and bizarre are the best because they capture what it feels like to be a kid, which is, everything is a huge deal and life or death and everything is scary and weird."

#### "It Was All About Let's Get Wealth" {#It_Was_All_About_Lets_Get_Wealth}

Here's a fantastic set of quotes at 22:34 from [Maria Bustillos](https://twitter.com/mariabustillos?lang%3Den) in the
[Decentralized Journalism](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/decentralized-journalism-a-conversation-with-maria-bustillos-c7f1e276799e) episode of the [Track Changes podcast](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/). I feel
the same about a lot of people who are solely speculators in the Bitcoin
and Ethereum systems.

> "The first time I went to a Bitcoin conference, I was actually so
> horrified that I just went off the whole thing for about a year. I was
> like, I just can't even believe this, it's so insane. [It was] these
> seasteading, libertarian, lunatics everywhere, you know, and I thought

>
> ...
>
> But you know when I was at that [conference], and it was just all
> about, it was all, the opposite of what motivates me, it was all about
> "let's get wealth, let's get more wealth", and they don't even know
> what they want it for, it's like, just wealth, that's it."


#### "Leadership Through Influence" {#Leadership_Through_Influence}

I was at a goodbye party for friend and leader our my church. She did
a lot of everything and is considered to be a dear friend and leader
of hundreds of people.

At one point someone whom I don't know mentioned that my friend is
an excellent example of **leadership through influence**. I just think
that's the perfect way to describe her style of leadership and I've
been thinking about it a lot ever since.


### 3/28/2018 {#3_28_2018}

This Ralph Waldo Emerson quote was shared with me by my friend Steve
at work today when talking about standards for standards sake:

> “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
> little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a
> great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself
> with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words,
> and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though
> it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure
> to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood?
> Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and
> Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit
> that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.”


### 2/13/2018 {#2_13_2018}

On [Episode 368](http://mentalpod.com/archives/4724) of the [The Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/episodes) podcast Paul
Gilmartin provides a wonderfully succinct explanation of the
"depression spiral" at **01:18:41**:

> "It's so easy to just sweep shit under the rug and go to our
> addictions and our life gets small, and we isolate, and we just **pile
> on the shame** and then the, the, you know the **compulsive behaviors**
> to try to **numb the shame** and it's a vicious cycle that just pushes
> us closer and closer to the brink, and I've lived it. It's no way to

### 2/5/2018 {#2_5_2018}

On [Episode 366](http://mentalpod.com/archives/4715) of the [The Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/episodes) podcast Paul
Gilmartin was discussing how self-improvement often improves your
relationships with the people that you love with his guest Jen
Elmquist LMFT. Here's a great quote from Ms. Elmquist at **28:45**:

> I think across the board our goal in life should be, to be as great as
> _we can be_ in order to make all of our relationships great.
>
> I know that sounds really lofty, but that's satisfaction, right? It's
> when we're relating well with ourselves, others, and the world around us
> we have a better experience and that's good for everybody involved.

### 07/18/2017 {#07_18_2017}

This is a quote from Tasha Robinson during the [Pt. 2 - Wonder Woman /
Paths Of Glory](https://thenextpictureshow.tumblr.com/post/162008521585/new-episode-part-2-of-our-discussion-of-world-war) episode of the [The Next Picture Show](https://thenextpictureshow.tumblr.com/) podcast. She ended
up really liking Wonder Woman, but here (at 03:41) she describes why
her expectations were so low:

>
>
> I think my expectations have been set by how much I've **consistently
> hated** the DC extended universe movies, how many problems I've had with
> them, both just in terms of them all kindof being narratively messy
> and/or, just insensitive to _basic humanity_.

My gripe with these especially bad superhero movies is that Warner
Brothers seems to be **consistently** making them like this on purpose
(with Wonder Woman as an exception). It seems bizarre to me that
someone sits in a room, has an idea to make a movie like Batman V
Superman, makes it, sees how it turns out, and then says "yes, that's
great, let's do that again".


### 3/27/2017 {#03_27_2017}

This is a great digital privacy quote from one of the ACLU panelists
on the [Tech at the ACLU: In practice, and in theory](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/tech-at-the-aclu-in-practice-and-in-theory-c7b9b85842dd) episode of the
[Track Changes podcast](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/tagged/podcast) (at the **16:28** mark):

>
>
> Digital privacy, and anti-surveillance and anti-censorship [...] while
> we're saying that this is _one_ of the issues that the ACLU covers,
> it's actually related to many, many issues.
>
> [...]
>
> And, if we're talking about [...] freedom of religion, if there's

> these tools, it's gonna be built using the data that's extracted from

### 2/7/2017 {#02_07_2017}

George Carlin, from [The Comedians](http://www.amazon.com/The-Comedians-Thieves-Scoundrels-American/dp/0802123988) book, about how the responded to all
of the terrible things that occurred at the end of the sixties:

>
>
> I didn't respond with rage to any of what was happening
> in 1968. Dr. King's murder in April was depressingly
> predictable. There was a sinking feeling: that something good was
> ebbing away and being encouraged in that direction by its usual
> forces. The establishment was winning -- its war, its assassins, its
> secret government -- and that fact overpowered and debilitated me
> more than it enraged me.


### 1/25/2017 {#01_25_2017}

Tim Bray, from his blog post [The Women's March](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/01/22/Womens-March) about the worldwide
protest of the new Trump administration that occurred the day after
his inauguration:

>
>
> I think it's obvious. A bunch of reasonable people, led by women,
> needed to shout out and reassure each other that they weren't crazy
> because they were horrified at a nouveau regime that's crude,
> threatening, ignorant, oligarchic, reactionary, childish, corrupt,
> bigoted, thin-skinned, offensive, and oozes appallingly bad taste.

### 12/16/2016 {#12_16_2016}

This is from the intro to the [The Dog That Caught The Car](http://www.danagould.com/the-dog-that-caught-the-car/) episode of
[The Dana Gould Hour](http://www.danagould.com/dgh/) podcast. Dana was referring to the "media
misinformation bubble" that he lives in:

>
>
> There are too are too many people in this country talking past each
> other. The internet, which was supposed to unite us, has divided us
> farther. And I am of the belief that the election of someone like
> Donald Trump is in part a direct result of an electorate too far
> ensconced in their own ideological readouts to communicate even the
> simplest disagreements constructively. And that has to stop.


### 12/01/2016 {#12_01_2016}

Cathy O'Neil on the [Weapons Of Math Destruction](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/podcast-39-cathy-oneil-on-weapons-of-math-destruction-ccc7fbcb0b6d#.kr3vhdhaf) episode of the [Track
Changes](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/) podcast. Earlier in the podcast she discusses her love of the
"purity" of math and her disappointment after learning that
Credit-Default-Swaps were being over-rated by ratings agencies in
2007 (at **16:57**):

>
>
> Math wasn't the problem actually. It wasn't that we had the **wrong**
> models, it's that we really don't care...about the truth, that it's
> become a political thing.


### 11/03/2016 {#11_03_2016}

Dana Gould on the [The Ghost & Mr. Halloweenery episode](http://www.danagould.com/the-ghost-mr-halloweenery/) of [The Dana
Gould Hour](http://www.danagould.com/dgh/) podcast at **3:16:40** speaking to legendary makeup artist
Rick Baker on how their "weird little hobbies" have lead to fulfilling
careers:

>
>
> The only thing that I've noticed in my storied career is that things
> lead to things, and if you do things and make things, things come of
> it. And if you don't do things and don't make things then things don't
> come of it.

The above quote from Dana Gould also reminds me of the ending of the book
[Smile](http://goraina.com/books/smile/) by Raina Telgemeier:

>
>
> My life didn't magically turn perfect after that. I didn't "get the
> guy" as they say. [...] Instead, I threw my passion into things I
> enjoyed, rather than feeling sorry for myself. I realized that I had
> been letting the way I looked on the outside affect how I felt on the
> inside. But the more I focused on my interests, the more it brought
> out things I liked about myself. And that affected the way **other**
> people saw me.

Joel Hodgson on the [The Ghost & Mr. Halloweenery episode](http://www.danagould.com/the-ghost-mr-halloweenery/) of [The Dana
Gould Podcast](http://www.danagould.com/dgh/) at **3:08:31** on why he temporarily retired from show
business immediately after turning down a lucrative sitcom offer
(after he'd done Letterman and SNL):

>

> Ultimately at the end of the day all you have to bargain with is

James Baldwin's advice on **why writers write** from [The Writer's

Michael Nygard in his [Software Eats The World](http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2015/10/software-eats-the-world/) article:

> Back in 2011, Marc Andreessen said ”[software is eating the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)”.
